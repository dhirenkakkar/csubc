# Linked_Images


Various image modifications using a circular doubly linked list implementation of image.

# Working 

- Each list is a circular doubly linked list with a section of image as the node.
- Used pointer arithmetic and dynamic memory management to perform numerous tasks on the image: K position roll, reverse, weaving two linked lists.
- *Most* methods have a space and time of complexity of O(n) or less.
