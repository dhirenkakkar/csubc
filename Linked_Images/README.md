# Linked_Images

Multiple image modifications and tweakings by using a circular doubly linked list of image type and playing around with it. 

# Working 

- Each list is essentially a circular doubly linked list with a section of image as the data of the node.
- Used pointer arithmetic and dynamic memory management to perform numerous tasks on the image: K position roll, reverse, weaving two linked lists.
- *Most* method have a space and time of complexity of O(n) or less.
